Given a number of files with time stamps and messagaes,
sort these messages according to the time stamps, and output them to 1 file with all the
sorted messages


what is going to contains in these files?

time stamp:messages

are going to be seperated by :

contents in the file:
already sorted in time stamp

file format?
txt

size of the file?
1 - 100 GB


output:
result should be sorted by the time stamps with all the messages from all files

Class Diagram:

Driver:
provides the file
start the merge

File Reader:
read the input file and store the file input to a map

Merge Sorted Map:
merge k sorted map into one big map in ascending order

MyFileWriter:
writes the result of the merging files to the out put files

solution:
file x
file y
file z

file output_xy
file output_xyz

first we read file x and y, use 2 pointers to compare the time
and output the smaller one to the output_xy file and then the bigger one

once we finish file x and file y, we have the output_xy sorted with the content of the file x and file y

then we start the same process with file z, to have two pointers points to 1 item in file z and output_xy
to get a file output_xyz


detailed implementation:
create 2 pointers to keep tract of the index of the line of the file, so we can compare each lines
read the files and for each line that the pinter points to, we compare the time
and out put the time and messages to a list of maps(we have a map of <timestamp, messages>
this map is static for all files, since it keeps all the contents in ordered

once we have the maps for all files sorted with time stamps, we start output the map to the files

        //read file x and file y, output to file xy
        File filexy= new File("/Users/serenapang/Development/Algorithms/src/oodesign/mergek/outputxy");
        reader.mergeFilesToAFile(filey,filex, filexy);

        //read output file xy and file z, output it to file xyz
        File filexyz= new File("/Users/serenapang/Development/Algorithms/src/oodesign/mergek/outputxyz");
        reader.mergeFilesToAFile(filexy,filez, filexyz);

        //merge all the files to output
        File fileoutput= new File("/Users/serenapang/Development/Algorithms/src/oodesign/mergek/output");
        reader.mergeFilesToAFile(filex,filey,fileoutput);
        reader.mergeFilesToAFile(fileoutput, filez,fileoutput);
